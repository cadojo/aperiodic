## JuliaCon 2021

As a graduate student, I developed an open-source astrodynamics package called
[GeneralAstrodynamics.jl](https://github.com/cadojo/GeneralAstrodynamics.jl). I used this 
package to investigate invariant-manifold-based Earth-Jupiter transfer designs.
This JuliaCon talk provides a brief introduction to astrodynamics, scientific 
computing, and Julia. The presentation slides and 
[Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook are available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/cadojo/juliacon).
