Resources paid for by taxpayers should not be used as props for a
partisan political stunt. The Houston Police Department (HPD) actions
taken at the Harris County Commissioners Court on October 11th were
wrong. Harris County taxpayers deserve to know how this event was
planned, and the organizers and attendees within HPD who used government
resources for partisan political gain should be held accountable.

The line between personal and professional actions may sometimes appear
thin. For governments, extra care must be taken to prevent even the
*appearance* of impropriety. As a result, government employees have more
to consider when planning political action, relative to other Americans.
If an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation wears an FBI
baseball cap while they attend a political rally in a personal capacity,
might they appear to be representing the agency? If Environmental
Protection Agency employees use their government email accounts to
organize a sit-in on the steps of the Supreme Court in protest of
decisions relating to climate change, are they violating federal
regulations? In my understanding, the answer to both of these questions
is: yes.

The [laws and
regulations](https://osc.gov/services/pages/hatchact-statelocal.aspx)
which relate to the previous two examples are not superfluous. They help
us --- as a nation --- walk that line between protecting the autonomy
and rights of individuals, and trusting the institutions we've assiged
with running our society. The spirit behind these guardrails is
important. *These rules protect *you* from the government*. This is what
it means to live in a country of laws. I am proud to live in a place
which takes care to protect the independence of the institutions
assigned with service to the public.

The actions taken by HPD officers at the Harris County Commissioner
Court on October 11th were not nuanced, or anywhere close to the
"ethical line". Officers in official uniforms brought [K-9
units](https://twitter.com/jen_rice_/status/1579863310685851650?s=20)
and
[weapons](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Harris-County-budget-live-updates-Police-presence-17501166.php)
into the halls of the Commissioner Court. They
[boo'd](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/At-Harris-County-Commissioners-Court-budget-17502354.php)
the commissioners as the meeting adjourned. They posed for a
[picture](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Harris-County-budget-live-updates-Police-presence-17501166.php)
with a banner that read: STOP DEFUNDING.

To me, the implicit intimidation on display by HPD officers against
elected officials is chilling, and the political action predicated on a
falsehood --- the
[falsehood](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Now-Republicans-are-defunding-police-17464442.php)
that Harris County officials have proposed defunding law enforcement ---
is cynical and condescending toward all voters. That latter point is, to
me, worsened by the fact that the officers *have to know* that their
funding is not in jeopardy; this necessarily means their actions at the
Court were in furtherance of a politically expedient *lie*. Still, I
understand that for Houston residents who are wary of national calls to
re-allocate police funding, the rule-bending by HPD at the Court may
feel like a small price to pay for a dramatic and public display of
support for law enforcement funding. To those readers, I say this: no
matter the issue, we cannot allow publicly funded apolitical
institutions to participate in partisan politics. To let HPD off the
hook for their misuse of taxpayer dollars is to fail to provide the
guardrails necessary for all Americans to have faith in the institutions
sworn to their service.
