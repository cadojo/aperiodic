:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The content here was originally written as part of a problem set assigned in a 
graduate launch and entry vehicle design course at the University of Maryland. 
The problem statement was educationally false, and I believe this was deliberate!
Either way, I'm thankful for that slight falsehood; it cemented my early understanding
of spacecraft entry dynamics, and has motivated this whole post.

## Space Mission Architecture & Design

Space engineers in America --- I don't have any experience anywhere else --- commonly reference 
a textbook which some refer to as the "Aerospace Bible". One engineer encouraged me to read this 
book by shouting _"you've better SMAD the f\*\*k up!"_ The book's true name is 
["Spacecraft Mission Analysis & Design"](https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Analysis-Design-Technology-Library/dp/1881883108/) (SMAD for short).
