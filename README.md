## Portfolio

See <portfolio.aperiodic.dev> for a kind of long-form, informal resume. This includes
ongoing open source work! This portfolio is more personal than professional. In the near
future, I'll add a formal resume and CV.

## Blog

I've titled this blog `aperiodicity`. Expect posts about scientific computing, and topics 
surrounding space systems engineering and space physics!

## Documentation

In the future, I hope to host all of my open source software documentation at 
<documentation.aperiodic.dev>.

## Notes

More formal note-sets on control & systems theory are in-work, and will be hosted at 
<notes.aperiodic.dev> soon!
