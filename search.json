    "text": "I developed a Julia package alongside my graduate astrodynamics courses, and I’ve registered this package in Julia’s package registry! Right now, the package provides calculations relating to conic orbits, and circular-restricted three-body orbits. I’m most proud of the package’s Halo orbit and manifold solvers! At my highest aspiration, this package will one day serve a purpose similar to Python’s excellent poliastro.\n\n\n\nCommon astrodynamical models are provided in another open-source Julia package I’ve written: AstrodynamicalModels.jl. This package currently includes restricted two-body, n-body, and circular restricted three-body spacecraft dynamics. The package extends the excellent ModelingToolkit.jl; check that out if you’re not familiar! Playing around with the symbolic-numeric “bridge” that ModelingToolkit provides helped me to re-learn some basic dynamics concepts (e.g. “oh yeah, the hessian of the potential energy equation is equivalent to the Jacobian of the system’s equations of motion!”) Documentation is available here!\n\n\n\nWhile this project is not yet open-source, it soon will be! I wrote this Julia package as a graduate student. It provides symbolic code generation for manipulator kinematics. To get this to work, I ended up reworking some simple C++, MATLAB, and Stan code generation capabilities in Symbolics.jl!\n\n\n\nThis project is an unofficial implementation of publicly available polynomial approximations for NASA’s Generic Transport Model aircraft. Check out this package if you want a sandbox dynamical model for a control theory project! I’m using this package as an example for a control theory note-set I’m writing."

I developed software for space robotics projects as an undergraduate and graduate student (C++), and open-source astrodynamics and robotics analysis tools (Julia). I have recently started maintaining and developing scientific software with Python.\n\n\nAerospace Controls\nI emphasized applied controls and control theory throughout my undergraduate and graduate coursework. I’m quite familiar with applying linear analysis methods to nonlinear dynamical systems, and most of my graduate course projects related to studying nonlinear analysis methods. As a student, I primarily investigated region of attraction estimation methods, and coherent structure (manifold) dynamics near equilibrium points. I studied flight dynamics relating to atmospheric vehicles, and spacecraft. I found a love for astrodynamics towards the end of my academic career!\n\n\nScientific Communication\nI will be honing my scientific communication skills over the next few years by writing open source notebooks about technical topics of interest! This process will contibute the growing list of free educational resources, and will help me to grow as a technical communicator. I’ve found that writing (and coding) technical concepts really helps me to solidify my own knowledge. I hope to produce content in forms similar to MIT’s excellent Computational Thinking series!"

You need to write your module’s contents to a .py file, make that file available on sys.path, and then load that module, i.e. with an import statement.

You’ll certaintly find names which are the purpose of the package, such as the Rectangular and Polar, and the rectangular and polar methods. Unfortunately, you’ll also find a lot of names you aren’t intended to use: Real, NamedTuple, atan2, sqrt, cos, sin, and dispatch.\nMost Python developers just ignore all of those names, and that is absolutely fine. Personally, as I write Python code, these extra names irk me a bit; why am I providing names which I never intend for my users to use?"

The rest of this post walks through this pattern in detail, and provides a bit more information which can help you determine if this pattern is useful for you.\n\nDefine Exported Names\nRust specifies elements of a public API by using the keyword pub. Julia specifies exported names with the keyword export. Python can provide the means to accomplish (practically) the same thing! (Let’s decide to define an __export__variable in all of our Python modules.) This __export__ variable should be some kind str collection, like a list, tuple, set, or any other Iterable type. Personally, I like using the set type because it feels most in keeping with the spirit of an exported names collection; names can’t be repeated, and order doesn’t matter!This rule also applies to packages and subpackages because they are also Python modules!\n__export__ = {\n    \"Rectangular\", \"Polar\",\n    \"rectangular\", \"polar\",\n}\n\n\nImport Temporary Names\nWith this __export__ collection defined, we can safely include any temporary names we want, just as we normally would. This commonly includes types defined in the built-in typing package. Import all of the temporary functionality you need, and don’t worry about polluting your module’s namespace; we’ll clean up this namespace soon!\nReal = int | float\nfrom typing import NamedTuple\nfrom plum import dispatch\n\n\nImplement the Public API\nYou have the temporary names you need to add proper typing and import-time functionality to your public API. Let’s actually write the API! This is equivalent to all of your exported names, as declared above in __export__.\nNote that, so far, we have only imported the import-time dependencies. We can’t import our usage-time dependencies in our module without adding them to __export__; otherwise, our module will throw a NameError as it attempts to reference previously deleted names!\nFor example, if we write from numpy import sin, cos in our top-level module, and then delete sin and cos at the end of the module, all code which relies on sin and cos at usage-time will be calling undefined functions! Rather than throw all of our usage-time dependencies into __export__, we can simply add them to our function definitions. If you’re worried that those imports will be loaded every time you call the function, don’t! Each import statement within a function is only evaluated the first time you call the function.\n\nclass Rectangular(NamedTuple):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines a two-dimensional rectangular coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    x: Real\n    y: Real\n\nclass Polar(NamedTuple):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines a two-dimensional polar coordinate.\n    \"\"\"\n    r: Real\n    θ: Real\n\n@dispatch\ndef rectangular(coordinate: Rectangular) -> Rectangular:\n    return coordinate\n\n@dispatch\ndef rectangular(coordinate: Polar) -> Rectangular:\n    # We've moved this import from the top-level module to within this function! \n    from numpy import sin, cos \n    return Rectangular(\n        x = coordinate.r * cos(coordinate.θ),\n        y = coordinate.r * sin(coordinate.θ),\n    )\n\n@dispatch\ndef polar(coordinate: Rectangular) -> Polar:\n    # We've moved this import from the top-level module to within this function! \n    from numpy import sqrt, arctan2 as atan2\n    return Polar(\n        r = sqrt(coordinate.x**2 + coordinate.y**2),\n        θ = atan2(-coordinate.y, coordinate.x),\n    )\n\n@dispatch\ndef polar(coordinate: Polar) -> Polar:\n    return coordinate\n\n\n\nDelete Private Names\nNow your module definition is coming to a close! You’re done implementing all of the features of your project, and you’re about to type if __name__ == \"__main__\". What I’m proposing, with this whole blog post, is this: don’t stop there! Add an else condition to that if statement!\nIf your module is not the top-level program (known as “main”), then you should clean up all of your non-exported names with the pattern below! You need to put this pattern under an else condition (or a __name__ != \"__main__\" condition) because Python interpreters, like IPython, stick “magic” global variables in the top-level namespace. You don’t want to delete those!\n\nif __name__ != \"__main__\":\n    for _ in (*locals(), \"_\"):\n        if not _.startswith(\"__\") and _ not in __export__:\n            del locals()[_]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article is a response to HPD action at the Harris County Commissioners Court on October 11th, 2022. A slightly shorter form was submitted as a letter to the Editorial Board of the Houston Chronicle, formally in response to Jen Rice’s article outlining the timing of events. Banner image credits to Jen Rice and the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\n\nTaxpayer dollars allocated toward public safety should not be used as props for a partisan political stunt. The Houston Police Department (HPD) actions taken at the Harris County Commissioners Court on October 11th were wrong. Harris County taxpayers deserve to know how this event was planned, and the organizers and attendees within HPD who used government resources for partisan political gain should be held accountable.\nThe line between personal and professional actions may sometimes appear thin. For governments, extra care must be taken to prevent even the appearance of impropriety. As a result, government employees have more to consider when planning political action, relative to other Americans. If an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation wears an FBI baseball cap while they attend a political rally in a personal capacity, might they appear to be representing the agency? If Environmental Protection Agency employees use their government email accounts to organize a sit-in on the steps of the Supreme Court in protest of decisions relating to climate change, are they violating federal regulations? In my understanding, the answer to both of these questions is: yes.\nThe laws and regulations which relate to the previous two examples are not superfluous. They help us — as a people — walk that line between individual citizens with autonomy and rights, and the institutions and structures trusted with running our society. The spirit behind these guardrails is important. These rules protect you from the government. This is what it means to live in a country of laws. I am proud to live in a place which takes care to protect the independence of the institutions assigned with service to the public.\nThe actions taken by HPD officers at the Harris County Commissioner Court on October 11th were not nuanced, or anywhere close to the “ethical line”. Officers in official uniforms brought K-9 units and weapons into the halls of the Commissioner Court. They boo’d the commissioners as the meeting adjourned. They posed for a picture with a banner that read: STOP DEFUNDING.\nTo me, the implicit intimidation on display by HPD officers against elected officials is chilling, and the political action predicated on a falsehood — the falsehood that Harris County officials have proposed defunding law enforcement — is cynical and condescending toward all voters. That latter point is, to me, worsened by the fact that the officers have to know that their funding is not in jeopardy; this necessarily means their actions at the Court were in furtherance of a politically expedient lie. Still, I understand that for Houston residents who are wary of national calls to re-allocate police funding, the rule-bending by HPD at the Court may feel like a small price to pay for a dramatic and public display of support for law enforcement funding. To those readers, I say this: no matter the issue, we cannot allow publicly funded apolitical institutions to participate in partisan politics. To let HPD off the hook for their misuse of taxpayer dollars is to fail to provide the guardrails necessary for all Americans to have faith in the institutions sworn to their service."

Sounds like we need equations! The equations that govern our system are often called equations of motion.

    "section": "Example",
    "text": "Example\nA really common system in engineering is known as the spring-mass-damper. We can roughly describe this system as a block on a table, which is connected to a spring. We can force (a.k.a. affect) this system by pulling on the block to extend or compress the spring.\n\nModel Construction\nLet’s figure out our equations of motion. The following question is usually a useful starting point: “what are the forces on our system?” We know we’ll have one external force: us pulling or pushing on the block! Let’s call this external force \\(f_e\\). We’ll also have a force due to the spring, and a force due to the friction between the block and the table. The force due to the spring will be proportional to the position of the block with respect to the spring’s neutral position: let’s call the spring constant \\(k\\). The force due to friction will be proportional to the velocity of the block (let’s forget about static friction for now): let’s call the coefficient of friction \\(d\\).\nWith all of the forces identified, we can start constructing the eqautions of motion for this system. If we call our block’s position \\(x\\), then the acceleration \\(\\ddot{x}\\) will be equal to the sum of our external force \\(f_e\\), the spring force \\(k x\\), and the force due to friction \\(d \\dot{x}\\). Summing these forces produces the following (common) spring-mass-damper equation, where \\(m\\) is the mass of the block.\n\\[\nf_e = m \\ddot{x} + d \\dot{x} + k x\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWe have our model! This is a second-order differential equation (Equation 1). It helps to divide all variables into two groups: parameters, and states. States describe the system at some point in time. In this case, state variables answer the following questions: “where is the block, what is the velocity of the block, and what is the acceleration of the block?” One set of valid state variables for this system is \\(x\\) and \\(\\dot{x}\\); we don’t need to include \\(\\ddot{x}\\) in our list of state variables because we can calculate \\(\\ddot{x}\\) from \\(x\\) and \\(\\dot{x}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe say “one set of state variables” because there may (and nearly always are) other valid state representations that could completely describe this system! State variables are not unique.\n\n\nIf we leave states as symbolic, and then look to the equation(s) of motion of a system, the parameters describe a specific instance of a system. Put another way, no matter what values \\(f_e\\), \\(d\\), and \\(k\\) take, this equation of motion is identifiable as a spring-mass-damper. For this reason, we can specify \\(f_e\\), \\(d\\), and \\(k\\) as parameters. We can assume a unit mass for the block for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameter \\(f_e\\) is our control parameter in this example, because we can change \\(f_e\\) to affect our system. For now, let’s not differentiate between control parameters and non-control parameters.\n\n\n\n\nCoding our Model\nWe can simulate these dynamics with Julia’s DifferentialEquations package. If you’re familiar with MATLAB, DifferentialEquations provides numerical integration solvers that are similar to MATLAB’s ode45 (and similar) solvers. We can use the ModelingToolkit package to conveniently put our model to code, and interface with DifferentialEquations for simulation.\n\nusing ModelingToolkit, DifferentialEquations, Plots\n\nNow that we have access to ModelingToolkit, let’s build the model!\n\n@parameters t fₑ d k\n@variables x(t) ẋ(t)\nδ = Differential(t)\n\neqs = [\n    δ(x) ~ ẋ,\n    δ(ẋ)~ - d*ẋ - k*x + fₑ\n]\n\nmodel = ODESystem(eqs, t, [x, ẋ], [fₑ, d, k]; name = :HarmonicOscillator)\n\n\\[ \\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x\\left( t \\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} =& \\textrm{\\.{x}}\\left( t \\right) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\textrm{\\.{x}}\\left( t \\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t} =& f_e - k x\\left( t \\right) - d \\textrm{\\.{x}}\\left( t \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSimulating our Model\nWith model defined above, we can use DifferentialEquations to simulate our system. Of course, to do this we’ll need to specify numerical values for our parameters, and initial conditions (the simulation starting point) for our state variables. The code below specifies some arbitrary initial conditions and constant parameter values, and simulates the resulting dynamics.\n\nproblem = let x₀ = 0.1, ẋ₀ = 0.0, dₙ = 0.5, kₙ = 0.9, fₙ = 1.0, Δt = 30.0\n    ODEProblem(\n        model,\n        [x => x₀, ẋ => ẋ₀],\n        (0.0, Δt),\n        [d => dₙ, k => kₙ, fₑ => fₙ]\n    )\nend\n\nsolutions = solve(problem, Tsit5(); reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)\nplot(solutions; linewidth = 2, dpi = 130, title = \"Spring Mass Damper Simulation\")"

    "text": "Overview\nNASA provides fantastic tools that are available for personal use – one such tool is NASA JPL’s HORIZONS. HORIZONS allows users to request positions, velocities, and physical attributes for thousands of bodies in our solar system. Users can request celestial body positions and velocities (often referred to as ephemeris) for several time steps. These orbital states are very accurately modeled! Ephemeris models often include relativistic effects, solar radiation pressure, aspherical bodies, and more. After receiving a grid of orbital states from HORIZONS, a user can interpolate between timesteps to find precise orbital states at any time.\nHORIZONS has a web interface, and email and Telnet interfaces. While the web interface is simple to use, it does not provide every capability offered by the email and Telnet interfaces. If you just want one ephemeris file for a specific use case, the web interface is probably ideal! While I’ve never used the email interface, I have used the Telnet interface – the Telnet interface can be invoked by entering telnet://horizons.jpl.nasa.gov:6775 in a terminal of your choice. Otherwise, if you want to batch-request many ephemeris files, read on for a walkthrough for requesting ephemeris files from HORIZONS within a terminal, without manually walking through the Telnet interface!"

    "title": "HORIZONS Scripting Interface",
    "section": "Procedure",
    "text": "Procedure\nRather than manually entering your desired ephemeris file attributes through HORIZONS’ web or Telnet interfaces, NASA JPL has provided open-source scripts for automatically fetching ephemeris data from JPL servers. The steps below provide all the information you need to use these scripts, and wrap them with a simple .sh script for ease of use.\nNote that the rest of this walkthrough requires you use a terminal within a Unix-like system. If you want to use a Windows machine, consider using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nIf you follow the directions in this walkthrough verbatim, you’ll fetch a CSV-formatted ephemeris file without any text labels, with columns (from left to right): Julian day, X Position (km), Y Position (km), Z Position (km), X Velocity (km/s), Y Velocity (km/s), Z Velocity (km/s).\n\nInstall Dependencies\nJPL’s scripts use expect, an automation tool, to interact with the HORIZONS Telnet interface (so you don’t have to). You will need both expect and telnet installed on your system. JPL’s output ephemeris files contain carriage return characters that are not expected by Unix-like systems. You can install and use sponge (often packaged with moreutils), as shown below, to help remove these carriage returns, and other extraneous information from the data files returned by HORIZONS. If you only wish to remove the carriage return characters, you can also simply open the output ephemeris file in VSCode – this will re-format the file for your operating system.\nInstalling Dependencies on MacOS:\n# Uses Homebrew, a MacOs package manager: https://brew.sh\nbrew install inetutils # provides telnet\nbrew install expect    \nbrew install moreutils # (optional) provides sponge\nInstalling Dependencies on Ubuntu:\n# Uses apt, the default Ubuntu package manager\nsudo apt install telnet\nsudo apt install expect\nsudo apt install moreutils # (optional) provides sponge\nInstallation on other systems (Debian, Arch, etc.) is likely very similar to the installation commands above.\n\n\nDownload JPL Scripts\nJPL HORIZONS maintains scripts which users interact with through the command-line. See the HORIZONS documentation, which states…\n\nThe command-line interface can be automated. However, this is no longer recommended given the APIs introduced in 2021. Deprecated example scripts may be found in the FTP directory and will be supported indefinately.\n\nThe script interface README offers information about the existing scripts. Download and read through this file before continuing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must verify you are permitted to download and use these scripts! Refer to the HORIZONS documentation, the command-line interface README, and the script contents to determine if your usage and context forbids you from using these resources. The remainder of this tutorial assumes the user has read these instructions, and has determined they meet the qualifications for downloading and using all HORIZONS resources.\n\n\n\nIf you determine you are permitted, download the vec_tbl and vec_tbl.inp from JPL’s servers. The latter sets input parameters for your requested ephemeris data, the former is the ultimate script users can call to get ephemeris data. Remember to read the HORIZONS documentation – usage may not be free for commercial use, and text in each script file may state that some users are not permitted to download and use the scripts.\nwget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/SCRIPTS/vec_tbl\nwget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/SCRIPTS/vec_tbl.inp\nWe’ll also need to make vec_tbl executable.\nchmod u+x vec_tbl\n\n\nSet Input Parameters\nThe input file, vec_tbl.inp, sets environment variables that vec_tbl uses to walk through the HORIZONS Telnet interface automatically. These parameters provide information like “where should the origin be placed” and “what time window, and what size timesteps should be returned”.\nEdit vec_tbl.inp with your desired ephemeris file parameters. Some helpful parameter values are provided below – these parameters will result in an ephemeris format with the following attributes:\n\nOrigin placed at solar system barycenter\nCSV output with Cartesian coordinates\nTime window from 2020 to 2070, with 6-hour increments\nNo text labels in the CSV data\n\nNote – you can replace @ssb with @sun to place the origin of the ephemeris data at the Sun’s center of mass.\nset   EMAIL_ADDR    \"your_email_address@aol.net\" ;\nset   CENTER        \"@ssb\"                       ;\nset   REF_PLANE     \"FRAME\"                      ;\nset   START_TIME    \"2020-Jan-1\"                 ;\nset   STOP_TIME     \"2070-Jan-1\"                 ;\nset   STEP_SIZE     \"6h\"                         ;\nset   CSV_FORMAT    \"YES\"                        ;\nset   VEC_TABLE     \"2\"                          ;\nset   REF_SYSTEM    \"J2000\"                      ;\nset   VEC_CORR      \"1\"                          ;\nset   OUT_UNITS     \"1\"                          ;\nset   CSV_FORMAT    \"YES\"                        ;\nset   VEC_LABELS    \"NO\"                         ;\nset   VEC_DELTA_T   \"NO\"                         ;\nset   VEC_TABLE     \"2\"                          ;\n\n\nFetch Ephemeris Data\nNow we can use vec_tbl to download Ephemeris data for any celestial body tracked by HORIZONS. The usage for vec_tbl is shown below.\n./vec_tbl <BODY_ID> <OUTPUT_FILENAME>\nThe second argument is the NAIF ID for the celestial body you’d like to track. IDs for common solar system bodies are provided in the table below.\n\n\n\nSolar System Body\nNAIF ID\n\n\n\n\nMercury Barycenter\n1\n\n\nVenus Barycenter\n2\n\n\nEarth-Moon Barycenter\n3\n\n\nMars Barycenter\n4\n\n\nJupiter Barycenter\n5\n\n\nSaturn Barycenter\n6\n\n\nUranus Barycenter\n7\n\n\nNeptune Barycenter\n8\n\n\nPluto Barycenter\n9\n\n\nSun\n10\n\n\nMercury\n199\n\n\nVenus\n299\n\n\nMoon\n301\n\n\nEarth\n399\n\n\nMars\n499\n\n\nJupiter\n599\n\n\nSaturn\n699\n\n\nUranus\n799\n\n\nNeptune\n899\n\n\nPluto\n999\n\n\n\nNote the output file will have a preamble, which includes physical characteristics of your selected celestial body, and other information.\n\n\nRe-format Ephemeris Data (optional)\nThe output format of the Ephemeris file will depend on your input parameters provided in vec_tbl.inp. If you’re following this walk-through verbatim (aka using the input parameters provided above), then your output file will have 7 columns: Julian day, date-time label, X, Y, Z positions, X, Y, Z velocities. All columns are numeric, with the exception of column 2 – this makes loading data into MATLAB, Python, or Julia a bit more complicated. We don’t need column 2 to interpolate between Cartesian states, because column 2 is simply a plain-language description of the Julian Day value in column 1. We can use sed and awk magic to strip out the second column, and remove the preamble from the Ephemeris file. The sed and awk commands below are taken directly from the two StackOverflow answers: sed reference, awk reference. Remember to replace <FILE> with your desired output file name!\n# Filter out data-file preamble\nsed -n '/\\$\\$SOE/,/\\$\\$EOE/{//!p;}' <FILE> | sponge <FILE> \n\n# Remove second column (data-time label)\nawk -F , 'BEGIN {OFS=FS}  {$2=\"\"; sub(\",,\", \",\"); print}' <FILE> | sponge <FILE> \nNow your file will have only comma-delimited rows of numbers!"
