    "title": "HORIZONS Scripting Interface",
    "section": "",
    "text": "How to fetch solar system ephemeris data for free!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial describes an indefinitely supported, yet obselete automated command-line interface to the JPL HORIZONS system. The recommended methods for automatically downloading JPL HORIZONS ephemeris data is the graphical interface, or the new REST API.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA provides fantastic tools that are available for personal use ‚Äì one such tool is NASA JPL‚Äôs HORIZONS. HORIZONS allows users to request positions, velocities, and physical attributes for thousands of bodies in our solar system. Users can request celestial body positions and velocities (often referred to as ephemeris) for several time steps. These orbital states are very accurately modeled! Ephemeris models often include relativistic effects, solar radiation pressure, aspherical bodies, and more. After receiving a grid of orbital states from HORIZONS, a user can interpolate between timesteps to find precise orbital states at any time.\nHORIZONS has a web interface, and email and Telnet interfaces. While the web interface is simple to use, it does not provide every capability offered by the email and Telnet interfaces. If you just want one ephemeris file for a specific use case, the web interface is probably ideal! While I‚Äôve never used the email interface, I have used the Telnet interface ‚Äì the Telnet interface can be invoked by entering telnet://horizons.jpl.nasa.gov:6775 in a terminal of your choice. Otherwise, if you want to batch-request many ephemeris files, read on for a walkthrough for requesting ephemeris files from HORIZONS within a terminal, without manually walking through the Telnet interface!\n\n\n\nRather than manually entering your desired ephemeris file attributes through HORIZONS‚Äô web or Telnet interfaces, NASA JPL has provided open-source scripts for automatically fetching ephemeris data from JPL servers. The steps below provide all the information you need to use these scripts, and wrap them with a simple .sh script for ease of use.\nNote that the rest of this walkthrough requires you use a terminal within a Unix-like system. If you want to use a Windows machine, consider using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nIf you follow the directions in this walkthrough verbatim, you‚Äôll fetch a CSV-formatted ephemeris file without any text labels, with columns (from left to right): Julian day, X Position (km), Y Position (km), Z Position (km), X Velocity (km/s), Y Velocity (km/s), Z Velocity (km/s).\n\n\nJPL‚Äôs scripts use expect, an automation tool, to interact with the HORIZONS Telnet interface (so you don‚Äôt have to). You will need both expect and telnet installed on your system. JPL‚Äôs output ephemeris files contain carriage return characters that are not expected by Unix-like systems. You can install and use sponge (often packaged with moreutils), as shown below, to help remove these carriage returns, and other extraneous information from the data files returned by HORIZONS. If you only wish to remove the carriage return characters, you can also simply open the output ephemeris file in VSCode ‚Äì this will re-format the file for your operating system.\nInstalling Dependencies on MacOS:\n# Uses Homebrew, a MacOs package manager: https://brew.sh\nbrew install inetutils # provides telnet\nbrew install expect    \nbrew install moreutils # (optional) provides sponge\nInstalling Dependencies on Ubuntu:\n# Uses apt, the default Ubuntu package manager\nsudo apt install telnet\nsudo apt install expect\nsudo apt install moreutils # (optional) provides sponge\nInstallation on other systems (Debian, Arch, etc.) is likely very similar to the installation commands above.\n\n\n\nJPL HORIZONS maintains scripts which users interact with through the command-line. See the HORIZONS documentation, which states‚Ä¶\n\nThe command-line interface can be automated. However, this is no longer recommended given the APIs introduced in 2021. Deprecated example scripts may be found in the FTP directory <fhttps://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/xfr/SCRIPTS/> and will be supported indefinately.\n\nThe script interface README offers information about the existing scripts. Download and read through this file before continuing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must verify you are permitted to download and use these scripts!\n\n\n\nRefer to the HORIZONS documentation, the command-line interface README, and the script contents to determine if your usage and context forbids you from using these resources. The remainder of this tutorial assumes the user has read these instructions, and has determined they meet the qualifications for downloading and using all HORIZONS resources.\n\n\nIf you determine you are permitted, download the vec_tbl and vec_tbl.inp from JPL‚Äôs servers. The latter sets input parameters for your requested ephemeris data, the former is the ultimate script users can call to get ephemeris data. Remember to read their license ‚Äì¬†usage may not be free for commercial use, and text in each script file may state that some users are not permitted to download and use the scripts.\nwget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/SCRIPTS/vec_tbl\nwget ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/SCRIPTS/vec_tbl.inp\nWe‚Äôll also need to make vec_tbl executable.\nchmod u+x vec_tbl\n\n\n\nThe input file, vec_tbl.inp, sets environment variables that vec_tbl uses to walk through the HORIZONS Telnet interface automatically. These parameters provide information like ‚Äúwhere should the origin be placed‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat time window, and what size timesteps should be returned‚Äù.\nEdit vec_tbl.inp with your desired ephemeris file parameters. Some helpful parameter values are provided below ‚Äì these parameters will result in an ephemeris format with the following attributes:\n\nOrigin placed at solar system barycenter\nCSV output with Cartesian coordinates\nTime window from 2020 to 2070, with 6-hour increments\nNo text labels in the CSV data\n\nNote ‚Äì you can replace @ssb with @sun to place the origin of the ephemeris data at the Sun‚Äôs center of mass.\nset   EMAIL_ADDR    \"your_email_address@aol.net\" ;\nset   CENTER        \"@ssb\"                       ;\nset   REF_PLANE     \"FRAME\"                      ;\nset   START_TIME    \"2020-Jan-1\"                 ;\nset   STOP_TIME     \"2070-Jan-1\"                 ;\nset   STEP_SIZE     \"6h\"                         ;\nset   CSV_FORMAT    \"YES\"                        ;\nset   VEC_TABLE     \"2\"                          ;\nset   REF_SYSTEM    \"J2000\"                      ;\nset   VEC_CORR      \"1\"                          ;\nset   OUT_UNITS     \"1\"                          ;\nset   CSV_FORMAT    \"YES\"                        ;\nset   VEC_LABELS    \"NO\"                         ;\nset   VEC_DELTA_T   \"NO\"                         ;\nset   VEC_TABLE     \"2\"                          ;\n\n\n\nNow we can use vec_tbl to download Ephemeris data for any celestial body tracked by HORIZONS. The usage for vec_tbl is shown below.\n./vec_tbl <BODY_ID> <OUTPUT_FILENAME>\nThe second argument is the NAIF ID for the celestial body you‚Äôd like to track. IDs for common solar system bodies are provided in the table below.\n\n\n\nSolar System Body\nNAIF ID\n\n\n\n\nMercury Barycenter\n1\n\n\nVenus Barycenter\n2\n\n\nEarth-Moon Barycenter\n3\n\n\nMars Barycenter\n4\n\n\nJupiter Barycenter\n5\n\n\nSaturn Barycenter\n6\n\n\nUranus Barycenter\n7\n\n\nNeptune Barycenter\n8\n\n\nPluto Barycenter\n9\n\n\nSun\n10\n\n\nMercury\n199\n\n\nVenus\n299\n\n\nMoon\n301\n\n\nEarth\n399\n\n\nMars\n499\n\n\nJupiter\n599\n\n\nSaturn\n699\n\n\nUranus\n799\n\n\nNeptune\n899\n\n\nPluto\n999\n\n\n\nNote the output file will have a preamble, which includes physical characteristics of your selected celestial body, and other information.\n\n\n\nThe output format of the Ephemeris file will depend on your input parameters provided in vec_tbl.inp. If you‚Äôre following this walk-through verbatim (aka using the input parameters provided above), then your output file will have 7 columns: Julian day, date-time label, X, Y, Z positions, X, Y, Z velocities. All columns are numeric, with the exception of column 2 ‚Äì this makes loading data into MATLAB, Python, or Julia a bit more complicated. We don‚Äôt need column 2 to interpolate between Cartesian states, because column 2 is simply a plain-language description of the Julian Day value in column 1. We can use sed and awk magic to strip out the second column, and remove the preamble from the Ephemeris file. The sed and awk commands below are taken directly from the two StackOverflow answers: sed reference, awk reference. Remember to replace <FILE> with your desired output file name!\n# Filter out data-file preamble\nsed -n '/\\$\\$SOE/,/\\$\\$EOE/{//!p;}' <FILE> | sponge <FILE> \n\n# Remove second column (data-time label)\nawk -F , 'BEGIN {OFS=FS}  {$2=\"\"; sub(\",,\", \",\"); print}' <FILE> | sponge <FILE> \nNow your file will have only comma-delimited rows of numbers!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "An introduction to dynamics through scientific software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffprint\n\n\n\nThis is a section from a control theory note-set I‚Äôm writing, Exploring Control Theory. It won‚Äôt be done for years! Over time, I‚Äôll add chapters to the open-source repository, https://github.com/cadojo/controls. Some chapters that stand on their own will be added as blog posts here!\n\n\n\n\nOur end goal as controls engineers is to affect a system in some desired way. To do this, we‚Äôll need a mathematical description of our system. This mathematical description is known as a model. There‚Äôs a famous quote about mathematical models: ‚Äúall models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù.\nThis is really important. We are always approximating our system by describing it with a model. The question we need to ask is ‚Äúis our approximate description of our system (our model) good enough?‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\nModel: a mathematical description of a system\n\n\n\nBut what does this model look like? To answer this question, let‚Äôs first discuss system dynamics, and equations of motion.\n\n\n\nIf we want to affect a system, then by definition, the system should be affect-able (is that a word?) by external forces. These ‚Äúforces‚Äù don‚Äôt necessarily need to be physical forces: consider the affect of introducing new predators in an ecosystem with the goal of affecting predator-prey populations.\nSo we have a mathematical description, and we know we‚Äôll need some changing parameter to affect the mathematical description. Sounds like we need equations! The equations that govern our system are often called equations of motion. Any system that changes due to some external ‚Äúforce‚Äù is known as a dynamical system by definition.\nThe first step to any controls problem is identifying the dynamics; this usually means defining the equations of motion for our system. A set of equations of motion which describe our dynamical system is our model.\n\n\n\nA really common system in engineering is known as the spring-mass-damper. We can roughly describe this system as a block on a table, which is connected to a spring. We can force (a.k.a. affect) this system by pulling on the block to extend or compress the spring.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs figure out our equations of motion. The following question is usually a useful starting point: ‚Äúwhat are the forces on our system?‚Äù We know we‚Äôll have one external force: us pulling or pushing on the block! Let‚Äôs call this external force \\(f_e\\). We‚Äôll also have a force due to the spring, and a force due to the friction between the block and the table. The force due to the spring will be proportional to the position of the block with respect to the spring‚Äôs neutral position: let‚Äôs call the spring constant \\(k\\). The force due to friction will be proportional to the velocity of the block (let‚Äôs forget about static friction for now): let‚Äôs call the coefficient of friction \\(d\\).\nWith all of the forces identified, we can start constructing the eqautions of motion for this system. If we call our block‚Äôs position \\(x\\), then the acceleration \\(\\ddot{x}\\) will be equal to the sum of our external force \\(f_e\\), the spring force \\(k x\\), and the force due to friction \\(d \\dot{x}\\). Summing these forces produces the following (common) spring-mass-damper equation, where \\(m\\) is the mass of the block.\n\\[f_e = m \\ddot{x} + d \\dot{x} + k x \\tag{1}\\]\nWe have our model! This is a second-order differential equation (Equation¬†1). It helps to divide all variables into two groups: parameters, and states. States describe the system at some point in time. In this case, state variables answer the following questions: ‚Äúwhere is the block, what is the velocity of the block, and what is the acceleration of the block?‚Äù One set of valid state variables for this system is \\(x\\) and \\(\\dot{x}\\); we don‚Äôt need to include \\(\\ddot{x}\\) in our list of state variables because we can calculate \\(\\ddot{x}\\) from \\(x\\) and \\(\\dot{x}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe say ‚Äúone set of state variables‚Äù because there may (and nearly always are) other valid state representations that could completely describe this system! State variables are not unique.\n\n\nIf we leave states as symbolic, and then look to the equation(s) of motion of a system, the parameters describe a specific instance of a system. Put another way, no matter what values \\(f_e\\), \\(d\\), and \\(k\\) take, this equation of motion is identifiable as a spring-mass-damper. For this reason, we can specify \\(f_e\\), \\(d\\), and \\(k\\) as parameters. We can assume a unit mass for the block for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameter \\(f_e\\) is our control parameter in this example, because we can change \\(f_e\\) to affect our system. For now, let‚Äôs not differentiate between control parameters and non-control parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can simulate these dynamics with Julia‚Äôs DifferentialEquations package. If you‚Äôre familiar with MATLAB, DifferentialEquations provides numerical integration solvers that are similar to MATLAB‚Äôs ode45 (and similar) solvers. We can use the ModelingToolkit package to conveniently put our model to code, and interface with DifferentialEquations for simulation.\n\nusing ModelingToolkit, DifferentialEquations, Plots\n\nNow that we have access to ModelingToolkit, let‚Äôs build the model!\n\n@parameters t f‚Çë d k\n@variables x(t) xÃá(t)\nŒ¥ = Differential(t)\n\neqs = [\n    Œ¥(x) ~ xÃá,\n    Œ¥(xÃá)~ - d*xÃá - k*x + f‚Çë\n]\n\nmodel = ODESystem(eqs, t, [x, xÃá], [f‚Çë, d, k]; name = :HarmonicOscillator)\n\n\nModel HarmonicOscillator with 2 equations\nStates (2):\n  x(t)\n  ·∫ã(t)\nParameters (3):\n  f‚Çë\n  d\n  k\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith model defined above, we can use DifferentialEquations to simulate our system. Of course, to do this we‚Äôll need to specify numerical values for our parameters, and initial conditions (the simulation starting point) for our state variables. The code below specifies some arbitrary initial conditions and constant parameter values, and simulates the resulting dynamics.\n\nproblem = let x‚ÇÄ = 0.1, xÃá‚ÇÄ = 0.0, d‚Çô = 0.5, k‚Çô = 0.9, f‚Çô = 1.0, Œît = 30.0\n    ODEProblem(\n        model,\n        [x => x‚ÇÄ, xÃá => xÃá‚ÇÄ],\n        (0.0, Œît),\n        [d => d‚Çô, k => k‚Çô, f‚Çë => f‚Çô]\n    )\nend\n\nsolutions = solve(problem, Tsit5(); reltol = 1e-12, abstol = 1e-12)\nplot(solutions; linewidth = 2, dpi = 130, title = \"Spring Mass Damper Simulation\")"
