## About Me

This is a personal website! I'll upload updates to my personal & professional [portfolio](portfolio/background/introduction.md),
technical and non-technical [blog-style](blog/index.md) posts, and (soon) technical notes explaining some topics I'm 
interested in. Comments are

## What does _aperiodic_ mean?

The URL of this site is [{{< meta website.site-url >}}]({{< meta website.site-url >}}). This is my attempt at a play on words! 
I'm a periodic developer --- my career primarily relates to aerospace engineering, but I 
write scientific software frequently to serve that purpose. I also [studied](portfolio/background/education.md) 
dynamics and controls, in that context aperiodicity refers to a non-periodic system. The term _aperiodic_ relates to 
my relationship with scientific software development, and a field I'm passionate about. For only $12 on Google's URL 
registrator, that's a steal!
